        <p>Stock Price Movement Predictor is solely modeled and designed for learning purpose. We do not guarantee anyone that using our app will make them profit. Stock Price Movement, to a great extent, is a random process and myriad of factors affect this movement, not just stock news headlines.
            Having said so, studying the effect of news in stock price is vital as it significantly impacts investors sentiment. For example, a news headline like "Apple's iPhone 13 production fell 20% in Sept-Oct" conveys a negative outlook on the company Apple Inc. Following such news, investors
            will have a negative sentiment around Apple. Stock news are tremendously available and easily accessibly in today's digital era. Every investor or trader keeps an eye on stock news. Such news carry opinions of various stakeholders and different metrics about the company. Soon, news items are transformed into investors sentiment and that drives the stock price.
