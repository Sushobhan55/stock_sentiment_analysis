# Stock Sentiment Analysis

# Stock price follows stochastic process / is random and it is affected by many variables in the market. Predecting it accurately is nearly impossible; however, closely analysing some of the factors including, but not limited to: earnings and profits, introduction of new product and change in management can give an idea of which way the stock price is moving.

# Such events are immediateldy reported on news. The news headlines (to great extent) convey the sentiment. Many investors and traders in the market react to such news and make their investment decisions, that drives the stock price. 

# The project "Stock Sentiment Analysis" utilizes a massive dataset of news headlines from the past ten years to predict the price movement. NLP technique that we have used here classifies the historical news headlines according to the price movement on the particular day. After the model is ready, news headlines from today (the day one uses our web-app) are passed into our model and that lists out predictions for each news headlines. Then it is upto user/trader/investor to make their decisions by analyzing the number of upward predictions and downward predictions.

# The project is presented in a navigable nice looking web-app.
